## 👋 About Me  

Passionate **Security Engineer** with a focus on **Cloud security, Network defense, and Threat detection.**  
I design, secure, and automate systems to ensure business continuity and data protection.  

I enjoy solving complex security challenges, building detection pipelines, and creating automated responses to evolving cyber threats. My approach blends both the *offensive* and *defensive* sides of cybersecurity — from identifying misconfigurations to engineering secure architectures.  

Currently advancing my expertise in **Cloud-native security**, **Zero trust frameworks**. My long-term goal is to become a **Cloud Security Architect**, helping organizations implement scalable, secure, and compliant infrastructures.
