### 2. **Voyage and Virtue**
The Voyage & Virtue project was designed as a cloud-based, adversary-simulation and defensive security initiative built entirely in AWS, combining red team, blue team, and purple team methodologies. The project centered around a fictional lifestyle brand environment in order to safely emulate attacker behavior, test detection pipelines, and evaluate defensive readiness in a realistic cloud architecture.

  
The red team performed reconnaissance, attempted initial access through login portals, explored privilege escalation opportunities, and executed controlled data-exfiltration tests using tokenized assets. In parallel, the blue team deployed GuardDuty, CloudWatch, EventBridge, IAM monitoring, and VPC Flow Logs to detect unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, and suspicious API behaviors in real time. To strengthen defensive intelligence, canary tokens and a lightweight honeypot were embedded across the environment to serve as tripwires, alerting the team whenever attackers interacted with sensitive resources.

  
The network was built using a multi-tiered VPC design with segmented subnets, security groups, NAT gateways, an S3-hosted application, and an ALB with WAF protection to mirror enterprise-grade infrastructure. The purple team produced concise MITRE ATT&CK–aligned playbooks documenting each attack vector, detection mechanism, and recommended response action. Ultimately, Voyage & Virtue demonstrated advanced skills in cloud architecture, threat hunting, adversary simulation, and AWS-native security operations.
